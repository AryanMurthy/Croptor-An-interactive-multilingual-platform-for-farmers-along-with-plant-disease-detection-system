# Croptor-An-interactive-multilingual-platform-for-farmers-along-with-plant-disease-detection-system
The project is focused to decrease the difficulty experienced by farmers and provide instant remedies and cure for the crops or plants that are either affected by unseasonal weather or pest intervention.The objective is to bring a solution to identify and solve disease in plants and crops.

# Proposed Techniques
1. Farmers can upload the photographs of disease affected plants or crops and solutions may be provided by experts & users linked to the app.
2. The user interface will be handy and farmers will be able to operate the app/website easily.
3. As a major implementation, we added a plant disease prediction system using deep learning techniques by which the farmer without asking any query can directly use and identify the problem on his own.
4. The platform will help the farmers to upload the images in a thread format so that any user can see the problem posted by the farmer and can write down solutions in comment format.
5. Even in the future, if anyone faces same problem then, with one search they can find previous solutions posted on the platform. This will make the work much easier.
6. The farmers can use the change language option to search among 121 languages available.
